		<h1><center>Paper Soccer </br> how to play</center></h1>
		<p>Paper soccer is a game for 2 players. Each of them has their own goal. There are 2 ways to win the game: </p>
		<ul>
			<li>Get ball into opposite player's goal</li>
			<li>Make opposite player not be able to do move</li>
		</ul>
		<p> During each turn you move the ball by drawing lines between neighboring points.</p>
